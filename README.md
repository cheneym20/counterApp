# counterApp
The counter app, like any other counter, count by 1 when you click on the button.  When you hold the screen down for one second, it will reset the counter to zero.
However, in this app, you are allowed to change by what number you can count by.  You could count by 5's instead of 1's.  You can change how many milliseconds it takes to hold down the screen to reset the counter to zero.
You are also allowed to change what background color to show in the counter screen.

Purpose:

To expand my skillset in Javascript and to use a more ES6 Javascript instead of my past projects which use more legacy code that would support internet explorer legacy browsers.
I've been able to utilize javascript object by creating an object blueprint and created an object using that object blueprint.

I've also put a lot of work into the settings screen to validate values.  And to ensure to save properly.
Note: This is touch screen compatible.

Please enjoy this counter.
